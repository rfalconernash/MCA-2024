# Romantic Piano
## Week 1
### Challenges with working with music and its related data
One potential challenge might be finding legitimate data for a musical work, such as finding the original sheet music or even the original
composer for a standardised jazz piece, for example. As music has become more
accessable and easier to distribute electronically, the DIY approach has made it harder to up keep musical data management to a 
high standard and thereore vital metadata like names of composers and editors can be lost. This issue is also seen in a different
way with romantic piano music as during the era of romanticism (around 1800 - 1910), data such as composer, title, date of publishing
was mostly handwritten and therefore easily lost.
