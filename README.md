# Romantic Piano
## Week 1
### Challenges with working with music and its related data
One potential challenge might be finding legitimate data for a musical work, such as finding the original sheet music or even the original
composer for a standardised jazz piece, for example. As music has become more
accessable and easier to distribute electronically, the DIY approach has made it harder to up-keep musical data management to a 
high standard and therefore vital metadata like names of composers and editors can be lost. This issue is also seen in a different
way with romantic piano music as during the era of romanticism (around 1800 - 1910), data such as composer, title, date of publishing
was mostly handwritten and therefore easily lost.

Another challenge working with music and it's data is obtaining licences and copyright of a piece of music. Obtaining access to music data for analysis or distribution can be challenging due to licensing restrictions or high costs associated with rights holders. This isnt so much an issue with my theme though as most of the composers in the early romantic period have died before 70 years ago - this means their music now lies in the public domain.
