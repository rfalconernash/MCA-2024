  <h1>Week[10]</h1>
  
  <p>This week we were tasked with comparing the similarity of two pieces in our theme using juypiter notebook and sonic visualiser using some code and csv files.
  Unfortunately, my computer has struggled with Juypiter so I was unable to complete the first section of this task</p>
  <p>However, I was able to complete the second section where we put our first piece that we used at the beginnng into
  sonic visualiser and transformed it into a midi file. This wasnt very successful with my piece as the program tried to quantise
  the notes too much as the piece is meant to be a little rubato. this caused some strange note entries at points.
  It also created a very unreadable score once the midi file was opened up with musescore with lots of demi-semi quaver notes
  and rests  as well as triplets. This is as a result of the program trying to process the rubato feel</p>

  <p> Information such as the title, correct rhythm, dynamics, and correct pitches were all lost during the midi encoding process </p>
