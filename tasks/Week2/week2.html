  <h1>Week[2] Music as Notation</h1>
  
  <p>This week we focused on how music notation 
  is processed by computers and programs such as Musescore. For this week, we put a pdf from our chosen theme into 
  Musescore to analyse and turn into playable audio. I chose a section of a romantic piano piece called Pensee Lyrique by Sergei Bortkiewicz
  to upload into musescore. You  can access this piece on musescore <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Pens%C3%A9es_lyriques,_Op.11_(Bortkiewicz,_Sergei)">here</a>
  </p>
  <p>Some problems that Musescore had with translating from a pdf into 
  Musescore format was: Not adding the title and composer, no pedal indications, incorrectly inputting
  crescendo/diminuendo markings and mistaking some naturals as sharps - these all had to be manually changed. Most of these issues
  were ones that we saw as a group on Tuesday across a variety of genres and sources - rock, pop, classical.

  <p> This is my screenshot of my transcribed mussescore of Pensee Lyrique</p>
