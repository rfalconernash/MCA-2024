  <h1>Week[4]</h1>
  
  <p>This week I further edited my MEI file of Pensee lyrique to include more metadata such as the publishing date, genre,
    and copyright licensing. I added links to the musescore page where I uploaded my arrangement of the piece so that whoever may be looking 
    at the MEI file could use it as reference to where the verovio file is derived from. I added copyright information to let viewers know 
    that the piece itself is within the public domain and isn't under any restrictions of use.</p>
