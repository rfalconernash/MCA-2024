  <p>Time-frequency analysis is the major one, which is not based on waveform but on the given characteristic of surfacing of spectral to show changes in frequency over time. Time-frequency 
	  analysis focuses on the study of amplitude modulation with respect to time. Among numerous methods of time-frequency analysis, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) technique transforms
	  has the ability of simultaneously displaying the time and frequency components. It is particularly valuable when non-stationary signals are to be analyzed, to wit, these are signals incorporating 
	  changes in frequencies with time, like e.g., in speech and music. For example, in an audio signal the frequency domain signal would show you the main shape and amplitude of the signal but will not
	  disclose the dynamics of the different frequency bands (e.g., whether higher frequencies are present only at certain points in time). On the contrary, a time-frequency analysis is capable of such 
	  a detailed waveform, that it can show you how certain frequencies (such as bass or treble) occur and vanish along the signal, which is important in such operations as speech recognition and music 
	  analysis.</p>
 <p> For example, looking at Morceaux de fantaisie,we can see by the waveform that the majority of the piece is quite quiet with the louder part of the section 
 	being towards the end. Its difficult to see with the waveform the specific beats or what pitches are being played. With the spectogram,
 	there are clear lines that indicate when a note has been played due to the decay of sound. </p>
