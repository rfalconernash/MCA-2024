  <h1>Week[9]</h1>
  
  <p>This week I used the 3 pieces in my theme from last week to create csv files of the chromagram, spectogram, and MFCC of each of the pieces.</p>
  <p>These csv files were then used to create histograms of all of the features in the pieces</p>
  <p> The screenshots of the sonic visualiser projects for each of the pieces will be shown below </p>

  <h2> Comparing MFCC histograms</h2>
    <p> As much as I tried to troubleshoot, I was only able to get 12 histograms to work for one of the pieces - Allegro Barbaro - 
      so I feel it would only be useful to compare the other two pieces.</p>
    <p> Almost all of the histograms produced from the 2 pieces follow a normal distribution bell curve with notably
      most of the values being close to zero. This is the exception of both histogram 0 and 1 where there are 2 peaks in the Liszt piece
      and 2 peaks in histogram 1 of the Rachmaninoff piece. The median values of both histograms 0 and 1 are also not close to 0 like
      the rest of the histograms.</p>
    <p> The Rachmaninoff histograms also have slightly more variation in the size and shapes of the curves which I expected
      as there is a bit more variation in that piece than the Liszt piece which is mostly quiet; even though they are a very similar style.</p>
